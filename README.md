# PyGame

This repository contains the implementation of the Sega Video Game, Columns.

Columns.py creates the objects with the appropriate variables and functions needed to implement the model behind the game. Columns_game.py imports Pygame, the third party library needed to convert the data in the model to a game 
with a fully functioning GUI. Lastly, Columns_ui reads the player's keyboard for game actions such as moving game pieces and quitting the game.
